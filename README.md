Simple to-do list program made with the Node.js framework made by a beginner in programming

Hi, my name is Lucas Gomes Santana. I'm a Brazilian high school student who discovered the world of programming a few months ago. Since then, I've been studying programming on my own through videos on YouTube and ChatGpt. I try to set aside a few free hours in some days a week to study programming, my time on certain days is short and sometimes I can barely use my notebook properly. But I still try to do my best studying in the few free hours and days that I have. If anyone who knows the subject better than me. I ask you to leave comments talking about improvements I can make to my code, frameworks and other resources related to programming that a beginner in the area like me can learn. I have knowledge in C, C++ and Java, but I'm wanting to master the Node.js javascript framework

I apologize if my GitHub is messy or poorly configured, because as I'm still getting to know the area better, I still don't know how to properly use many programming tools
